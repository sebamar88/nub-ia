// Contract bounded stop. Partial, blocked, unavailable, or exhausted proof
// becomes one **Needs your decision** result instead of more verification; the

// validation stop after a bounded correction; a quick check runs once; an
// unavailable verifier is reported, never retried or escalated.
// These are instruction-delivery contracts, not proof of model adherence.
