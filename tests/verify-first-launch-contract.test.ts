// gentle-shell#1731 T16 (S5; L33-L34): in the after3 bench (B x4/x5) the first
// verify launch ran no probes because the handoff said only "read-only" and
// named no probe commands or isolated state, so every probe was reported
// unverified and the parent continued the task (~2 min per cell). Read-only now
// means no repository or git-state edits, and probes in a fresh scratch copy run
// on the first launch.
// T17 (S3; L33-L34): B x4 delegated a 1.2 min exploration and then the parent
// re-read the same 10 files; exploration is delegated only for a map the parent
// needs to decide or route.
// These are instruction-delivery contracts, not proof of model adherence.
