// explicit reports by the orchestrator through gentle_odd_phase, which
// refine it with phases tools cannot show (see
// assets/orchestrator-tracking.md). Never inferred from assistant prose;
// the prompt falls back to the generic "working…" label when nothing applies.

// Covers the ODD protocol steps in AGENTS.md (1 authorize .. 7 close); not a
// strict one-to-one mapping. "researching"/"deciding" both cover step 3
// (resolve uncertainty), and "deciding" also covers step 4's classify
// decision (no dedicated label: classifying is typically an instantaneous
// internal decision, not standalone visible work). "checking"/"closing"
// both cover step 7 (close).
