## Features

---

### gentle-shell — Your coding agent, in the workspace you lead

<img width="100%" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d9eefc2-7b2a-48f8-b212-1439834ce195" alt="gentle-shell running a live agent session: a header row with branch, model, and context gauge above the transcript, with status, changes, and todo cards in the right rail">

A bare terminal answers "what is the agent doing?" only with scrollback. gentle-shell turns your Pi session into a workspace: agent orchestration, live changes and runtime status, usage monitoring for supported provider accounts, and built-in diff views — so you lead the work instead of chasing it.

### el Gentleman — Think before you build

Say what you need once, then keep moving. el Gentleman helps turn intent into clear scope, a sensible next step, and evidence people can review — without making every task feel like a process meeting.

**[Docs →](docs/readme-reference.md#organic-driven-development)**

---

### Focused agents — Context with a return path

<img width="100%" src="docs/assets/diagrams/agent-orchestration.svg" alt="Diagram of one parent session directing bounded map, implementation, and verification work and receiving evidence back">

Bring in help without losing the thread. Focused package-owned Pi agents can map a codebase, implement a bounded change, or verify it, while one parent stays accountable for the scope, the decisions, and the final summary.

**[Docs →](docs/readme-reference.md#how-the-harness-decides-what-to-do)**

---

### ODD — The everyday workflow

<img width="100%" src="docs/assets/diagrams/odd-workflow.svg" alt="Organic Driven Development as seven numbered steps: Authorize, Explore, Resolve uncertainty, and Classify across the top row; Classify forks, so small understood work stays light while substantial work gets step five, Track, with one feature document; both paths converge on Implement task by task and then Close, above a dashed band marking that one feature document mirrored in Engram lets work resume across sessions">

**Organic Driven Development (ODD)** is the everyday path: the agent explores before changing anything, clarifies only real decisions, and keeps small understood work small. Substantial, authorized work gets one recoverable feature document — mirrored in memory when available — so progress, evidence, and the next step survive an interruption; checks follow the configured TDD mode.

**[Docs →](docs/readme-reference.md#organic-driven-development)**

---

### Native review — Review the exact change

<img width="100%" src="docs/assets/diagrams/native-review.svg" alt="Diagram showing one frozen candidate passing through risk-scoped native review to an outcome, while human delivery choices stay separate">

Review the exact change, not a moving target. Native review keeps one candidate in view, returns risk-scoped evidence, and can surface a bounded correction path. You still decide what happens next in your repository.

**[Docs →](docs/review-integration.md)**

---

### Gentle Changes — Every edit, attributed and reviewable

<img width="100%" src="docs/assets/features/changes-view.png" alt="Gentle Changes viewer: worktree accordion with per-file status on the left, the captured diff with line counts on the right, and a keyboard hint row">

You should not have to run `git status` to find out what your agent did. Gentle Changes captures the successful write and edit tool calls from the current session and its owned subagents — no repository scans, no background polling — and shows them in a two-pane viewer with per-file line counts and an honest **diff unavailable** when an external edit breaks continuity. Coverage stops at those tools, so shell commands and failed runs leave no row, and a missing entry never proves a clean tree. `alt+g` opens it; `o` drops the real file into your editor.

**[Docs →](docs/gentle-shell.md#browse-captured-diffs)**

---

### Gentle Agents — Parallel work with a live view

<img width="100%" src="docs/assets/features/agents-view.png" alt="Gentle Agents overlay showing a completed subagent thread with model, tokens, and elapsed columns, and the structured handoff it returned">

Delegating work should not mean losing it. Every subagent runs as its own process with a live card above the editor — model, tokens, cost, elapsed — and `alt+a` opens the full view with retained threads, stop controls, and history restored on resume. A child can ask you a question as an ordinary dialog, and background results come back as cards that start a new turn — nothing polls.

**[Docs →](docs/gentle-shell.md#gentle-agents)**

---

### Profiles and model routing — One deliberate decision per knob

<img width="100%" src="docs/assets/features/profiles-routing.png" alt="Profiles view: profile list on the left, orchestrator model and effort on the right, with per-role profile routing and effective current routing">

Model, effort, and who does what should be choices, not accidents. Named profiles route the orchestrator atomically and independently from packaged and review roles; a repository can pin its profile so its subagents stop following the globally active one, and the panel always shows the routing the runtime actually uses.

**[Docs →](docs/readme-reference.md#agent-model-profiles)**

---

### 🚀 YOLO 🔥 — Session permission, destructive guards intact

> 🚀 **Full speed, destructive actions still ask.** YOLO removes repeated permission questions for ordinary already-scoped work, which suits long autonomous runs. Destructive operations still require fresh confirmation.

`/nubia:yolo enable` supplies standing permission for ordinary already-scoped implementation, checks, commits, non-force pushes and PR creation. Default **OFF**, interactive primary TUI only, bound to the live session and Git clone; `/nubia:yolo disable` revokes it and `/nubia:yolo status` checks it. With no argument, `/nubia:yolo` opens a menu (`enable`, `disable`, `status`) showing the current state; cancelling changes nothing, and without an interactive menu it reports status. Reload and session replacement reset it. Active status plus a separate widget show **🚀 YOLO ON 🔥 — destructive confirmations remain**. Explicit restrictions, configured confirmations/blocks, consequential unresolved choices, destination/credential ambiguity and native consent/recovery decisions remain mandatory. Children get no independent delivery grant. This is not a sandbox.

Or open `/nubia:customize` → **Editor** and select **YOLO: OFF · session only**, immediately below Vim. Enter or Space toggles the same live-session permission as `/nubia:yolo`; browsing and previews never activate it. Unlike Vim, YOLO is not saved in preferences or visual profiles.

**[Use and limits →](docs/yolo-mode.md)**

### Command palette — Every command, one keystroke away

Extension commands are only useful if you can find them. `alt+k` opens a curated, grouped palette — Configuration, Session, Diagnostics, and Skills — searchable by label, command name, or description, showing entries only when they are actually registered.

`/nubia:customize` opens an interactive panel to set animation quality, startup banner rose, text logo and color, or choose an installed Pi theme. Highlighting a theme previews its source palette without changing the active theme; press Enter or Space to apply it through Pi. If its source is unreadable, the preview is unavailable. Status defaults to a right rail in fullscreen terminals at least 140 columns wide, and to a bottom bar otherwise. Choose right, bottom, or hidden (which removes both the rail and the bottom status bar at every width), move the fullscreen header below the input (below the 140-column breakpoint only one status row paints: a top header replaces the bottom bar, while with the header below the input the bottom bar alone carries the header's context, cost, and usage plus extension statuses), select comfortable/compact/minimal density, and toggle Changes, Agents, TODO, usage/cost, and model details independently. Layout changes and reset take effect immediately; banner changes appear on the next startup. The Editor category offers explicit Vim enable/disable controls for the global prompt preference; highlighting shows the persisted preference and effective prompt state without changing either. Enter or Space saves it and updates the live prompt; unsupported editors keep ordinary editing even when the saved preference is on. Vim is not included in visual profiles or visual reset. The History category turns prompt-history capture on or off; it is off by default, applies to the next prompt without a restart, and never deletes stored history. An explicit `GENTLE_PI_HISTORY_CAPTURE` value overrides the saved choice, and the panel marks that override (see [Prompt history](docs/prompt-history.md)). The panel can reset visual, banner, and animation settings to defaults. Press `p` for named visual profiles: `s` saves the current installed theme, banner, animation and layout; select a profile with ↑/↓, then use `r` to replace, `a` to apply, or `d` to delete. `z` clears only the profile catalog. Confirm destructive/apply actions with `y`, or cancel with any other key; Esc returns without applying a preview. Applying independent stores is not atomic: partial failures identify what changed.

### What's new in v3.5

The [v3.5.1 release](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-shell/releases/tag/v3.5.1) makes Gentle Shell runnable on its own:

- **Standalone launcher:** `npm i -g gentle-pi` installs `gentle-shell`, which opens Pi with the Gentle Shell package loaded from its own home (`~/.gentle-shell/agent`) or, with `--link`, from your existing `~/.pi/agent`; `gentle-shell install npm:<pkg>` and the other pi subcommands run against the selected home. A bundled or `PATH` pi is used, never a modified one.
- **Link mode take-over:** when `~/.pi/agent` already declares gentle-pi as a path package, the launcher takes over extension loading (`--no-extensions` plus explicit `-e` for every other declared package and loose extension) so tools never register twice.
- **Interactive RPC hosts:** with `GENTLE_SHELL_INTERACTIVE_HOST=1` and `--mode rpc`, ask-user tools use pi's RPC dialogs and gentle-agents publishes live subagent activity for the desktop app. See the [reference](docs/readme-reference.md#interactive-rpc-hosts).

</p>

## Get started

> **Naming transition:** The product is called `gentle-shell`; the current npm package and repository remain `gentle-pi` until migration.

### Path A: standalone `gentle-shell` (recommended, no pi changes)

`gentle-shell` opens Pi with the Gentle Shell package loaded, without installing it into your pi agent or editing its `settings.json`.

```bash
npm i -g gentle-pi

# Own home, never touches your pi install
gentle-shell

# Reuse your pi sign-ins, models and chats instead
gentle-shell --link
```

`gentle-shell` alone starts in its own home, `~/.gentle-shell/agent`, and sets that home up on first run — no separate step. Gentle Shell keeps its own home with the Gentle AI companion packages and no conflicting plugins; gentle-pi itself always stays this launcher's own copy, never one installed into the home; your pi install is untouched. That home also defaults to the Gentleman-Cute theme unless you set your own. `gentle-shell --link` reuses `~/.pi/agent` as-is, is never auto-provisioned, and never has its theme touched.

```bash
# Re-run provisioning by hand, e.g. to see the full install output
gentle-shell setup
```

`gentle-shell setup` installs the same companion packages gentle-ai provisions into a regular Pi, into this home only, then removes the one package that conflicts with gentle-pi's own `ask_user_question` tool (gentle-ai #4820). The first `gentle-shell` launch in a home already runs this automatically; `setup` is for re-running it by hand. See **[First run](docs/readme-reference.md#first-run-in-an-isolated-or-custom-home)** for the opt-out (`GENTLE_SHELL_NO_AUTO_SETUP=1`) and failure behavior.

```bash
# Make --link the default
gentle-shell home link
```

Every other argument is forwarded to pi unchanged, for example `gentle-shell --mode rpc` or `gentle-shell -p "..."`. Full flags, env vars, and modes: **[launcher reference](docs/readme-reference.md#nubia-launcher)**.

### Path B: inside an existing pi

Install the stable release into an existing pi agent, restart Pi, then synchronize the installed assets.

```bash
# Published stable release: v3.5.1
pi install npm:gentle-pi@3.5.1

# Restart Pi, then run:
gentle-ai sync

# Start Pi in your project
pi
```

See the [v3.5.1 release notes](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-shell/releases/tag/v3.5.1) for version-specific changes.

**Builtin codemode warning.** gentle-pi replaces Pi's builtin `codemode` with its compact renderer, so Pi warns at startup that the builtin was not loaded. In your own Pi home (`pi` with this package, or `gentle-shell --link`), gentle-pi asks once in the interactive TUI whether to add `"-builtin:codemode"` to `extensions` in the agent `settings.json` (usually `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`); it writes only if you accept, and the warning disappears from the next launch. A declined prompt is not repeated. To silence it by hand, add the entry yourself, for example `"extensions": ["-builtin:codemode"]`. Isolated `gentle-shell` homes already carry it.

### NaN model provider

The first-party `nan` provider is included; no third-party provider package is required. Set `NAN_API_KEY` before starting Pi, or use native `/login` → NaN (also `/login nan`), then use `/model` to select a model. Both login routes await explicit API-key input; blank or whitespace-only entries fail without saving a credential, and surrounding whitespace is trimmed. Cancellation leaves the stored key unchanged. Stored keys take precedence over `NAN_API_KEY`. Pi streams chat completions through its OpenAI-compatible provider. Model discovery intersects NaN's authenticated `/v1/models` response with a maintained subset of known chat IDs from the [official model documentation](https://nan.builders/docs/models); unknown and non-chat IDs are omitted. A successful response with no known chat IDs stays empty. Documented context, reasoning, and text/image capabilities are preserved with conservative numeric bounds for abbreviated limits; audio input is not advertised by Pi. Where NaN does not publish an output maximum, the provider configures a conservative 8,192-token cap rather than claiming the model's true limit. Before a successful refresh, all seven documented chat models are available as the offline fallback in `/nubia:models`: `glm5.3`, `deepseek-v4-flash`, `glm5.3-flash`, `qwen3.8-flash`, `mimo-v2.6-flash`, `gemma4`, and `qwen3.6`. This fallback declares documented support, not proof of access for your key. Once refreshed, the successful live key-scoped list remains authoritative (including an empty list), even offline or after a failed refresh. Changing credentials resets the catalog to the full documented fallback until discovery succeeds for the new key. NaN MCP search and media bridges are not included.

```text
/nubia:status
/nubia:doctor
```

> **RDD is opt-in:** enable native receipt-driven development only through an explicit `/nubia:review-mode enable` decision. The `.git/gentle-ai/candidate-views` parent must sit on a filesystem that honors private POSIX modes (or equivalent Windows ACLs); WSL DrvFS mounts without metadata can reject START before lineage creation.

> **Fullscreen installation note:** a recognized global installation persists Pi’s `"tuiMode": "fullscreen"` setting. Project-local and other install paths do not receive that change.

> **Interactive RPC hosts:** the desktop app sets `GENTLE_SHELL_INTERACTIVE_HOST=1` automatically, without touching your Pi config — see the [installation reference](docs/readme-reference.md#interactive-rpc-hosts).

For prerequisites, source-checkout instructions, full install behavior, and release policy, use the **[installation reference](docs/readme-reference.md#install)**. For everyday work, describe the outcome and follow [ODD](#odd--the-everyday-workflow).

## About the author

`gentle-shell` is built by [Alan Buscaglia](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming), the maker behind Gentleman Programming. It grew from a practical belief: capable agents are more useful when the human’s intent, review load, and delivery judgment stay visible all the way through the work.

Startup intro collaboration: thanks to [@aporcelli](https://github.com/aporcelli) and [`pi-gentle-startup`](https://github.com/aporcelli/pi-gentle-startup), which inspired the clean-screen startup animation, compact runtime panel, and pink visual treatment.
